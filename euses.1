.TH ASH-EUSES 1 2020-06-11 git.suugaku.co.uk "General Commands Manual"
.SH NAME
ash-euses \- a rewrite of
.BR euses(1) " for modern Gentoo-like systems"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ash-euses
.RI "[" "OPTIONS" "]... [" SUBSTRING "]..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR ash-euses " searches for substrings in USE-description files in the "
various repositories, as enumerated by the contents of the
.IB PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT /repos.conf/
directory. Each regular file in the directory is assumed to be a
repository-description and parsed, extracting the
.BR location " attribute to find the base of the repository. Most users will"
only care about the
.BR ::gentoo " repository, however"
.BR ash-euses " is capable of scanning an arbitrary number of repositories."
.IR PORTDIR " is also respected as an environment variable or entry in"
.BR make.conf ", however it is highly discouraged due to deprecation by the "
Gentoo developers.

.BR ash-euses " scans files matching"
.IB BASE /profiles/*.desc
where
.IR BASE " is the value from the"
.BR location " attribute. Currently, it does not recurse into the " base/
directory, however this is planned for the reasonably immediate future.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-\-help", " \-h"
Print a short summary of the syntax commands and quit.
.TP
.BR "\-\-version", " \-v"
Prepend the output with the versioning, author, and licence information.
.TP
.BR "\-\-list\-repos", " \-r"
Prepend the output with a list of the repository names and locations, collected
from the configuration files in the
.IB PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT /repos.conf/
directory.
.TP
.BR "\-\-repo\-names", " \-n"
Append the repository name to every match, in the form of
.BI :: repo
.RI where " repo"
is the name taken from the repository-configuration file.
.TP
.BR "\-\-repo\-paths", " \-p " "(implies " \-\-repo\-names )
Append the repository name and file location on a new line to each match, in the
form
.BI (:: repo " => " file )
.RI "where " file 
is the path of the description file in which the match was found.
.TP
.BR "\-\-strict", " \-s"
Restrict the searching to the USE-flag field, as opposed to searching the entire
file. This will significantly reduce the yield of the search on most systems.
This behaviour is likely to become the default in the near future, replaced with
.RB a " \-\-lax" " option".
.TP
.BR "\-\-quiet", " \-q"
.RI "Suppress the complaint message that arises when " PORTDIR " is detected"
.RB "on the system. See " NOTES " for more information regarding the issues of"
.IR PORTDIR " on modern Gentoo-like systems."
