# OWD-EUses Source Archive and Presentation

This repository contains an archive snapshot of my OWD-EUses Gentoo querying
tool, originally written in 2020 under the name 'ash-euses'. For a complete
description of the product, see the README.old file, noting that the links and
licensing information contained therein no longer applies (the current
repository is under the MIT Licence).

A LaTeX/Beamer project presentation is also included under '/presentation'. This
was created to assist in various placement company interviews which take place
throughout September and October 2023; many companies recommend that applicants
arrive to interviews equipped with some expository independent work to
substantiate their oft-fanciful claims of engineering grandeur.
