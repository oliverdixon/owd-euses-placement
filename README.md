# `owd-euses` Source Archive and Presentation

This repository contains an archive snapshot of my `owd-euses` Gentoo querying
tool, originally written in 2020 under the name `ash-euses`. For a complete
description of the product, see the [old README](original/README) file, noting
that the links and licensing information contained therein no longer apply (the
current repository is under the MIT Licence).

A LaTeX/Beamer [project presentation](presentation/) is also included. This was
created to assist in various placement company interviews which take place
throughout September and October 2023; many companies recommend that applicants
arrive to interviews equipped with some expository independent work to
substantiate their oft-fanciful claims of engineering grandeur.

**NOTE:** My development standards have improved significantly since authoring
the original program. I certainly would not consider the code contained within
the [original directory](original/) to stand at an acceptable level of quality.
Therefore, a small portion of the code has been modified (principally regarding
the level of abstraction) for the purposes of presentation; the revised files
can be found at [presentation/listings](presentation/listings/).
