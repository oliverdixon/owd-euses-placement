# `owd-euses` Source Archive and Presentation

This repository contains an archive snapshot of my `owd-euses` Gentoo querying
tool, originally written in 2020 under the name `ash-euses`. For a complete
description of the product, see the [old README](README.old) file, noting that
the links and licensing information contained therein no longer apply (the
current repository is under the MIT Licence).

A LaTeX/Beamer [project presentation](presentation/) is also included. This was
created to assist in various placement company interviews which take place
throughout September and October 2023; many companies recommend that applicants
arrive to interviews equipped with some expository independent work to
substantiate their oft-fanciful claims of engineering grandeur.
