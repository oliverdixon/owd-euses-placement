The always-changing TODO list for ash-euses.
--------------------------------------------

Include coloured output (?);

Investigate the alternatives to strstr(3), preferring performance. Perhaps the
Boyer-Moore algorithm could be of assistance; some other major file-searchers
have implemented it over glibc's strstr (ag-silversearcher) ?

Address the many TODOs in the code, e.g.\ eradicate usage of d_type to boost
portability to almost any UNIX-like system. I would also like to remove the
reliance on strcasestr for case-insensitive search (ARG_SEARCH_NO_CASE), however
I can't rewrite one myself that can touch it w.r.t.\ performance.
