`ash-euses` ("the Program") is a rewrite of the  classic  Gentoo  Linux  utility
`euses`, originally authored by Jeroen Roovers [1, 2], as an attempt to  rectify
some of the issues presented by modern Gentoo systems to the  original  utility.
The Program is still unstable and in an alpha state, however due to its relative
simplicity, should become usable shortly, with a featureset comparable  to  that
of Roovers' tool.

The Program requires the standard C library to build, and has only  been  tested
on glibc, however should work on any compliant implementation.  It  is  written,
in its entirety, in C99, to  work  exclusively  on  Gentoo  Linux  systems.   It
supports the modern `location` attribute notation, set in the various repos.conf
files [3], and is capable of traversing an arbitrary number  of  *.{,local.}desc
files in a similarly arbitrary number of repositories.  The existence of a valid
PORTDIR (obsolete) or `repos.conf/gentoo.conf` is  a  hard  requirement  of  the
Program, as defined at [4].

I welcome any contributions or enquiries, which can be directed in plain-text to
ash@suugaku.co.uk.  The Program and all of its components are released under the
WTF Public License, aside from where  stated  otherwise  (the  standard  library
headers).  The entire licence can be viewed at [5] or in the  Program's  LICENCE
file.
