NOTE REGARDING THE CURRENT STATE:

This application is now of a reasonable quality, and can thus be  considered  as
Alpha software.  Many features are yet to be added, few of which are included in
the README body, however it works at a  basic  level.   The  yield  is  severely
lacking  compared  to  the  original  tool,  as  it  only  scans   files   <repo
base>/profiles/*.desc,  which  is  terribly  inflexible,   however   should   be
moderately simple to drastically improve for the Beta release.

Inexhaustive TODO list for the next major release:

        [ ] Include coloured output;
        [ ] Increase the number of  files  searched  to  include  profiles/desc/
                *.desc; this will drastically increase the search yield. Perhaps
                the user could be given slightly more  control  regarding  which
                files  should  and  should  not  be  searched   (e.g.,   exclude
                architectures which do  not  align  with  that  of  the  current
                system).
        [ ] Investigate the alternatives to strstr(3),  preferring  performance.
                Perhaps the Boyer-Moore  algorithm  could  be  of  assistance  ?
        [ ] Address the many TODOs in the code, e.g.\ eradicate usage of  d_type
                to boost portability to almost any UNIX-like system;
        [ ] Implement a repository-description cache, reducing start-up time for
                99% of cases, as ash-euses will no longer have to go trailing
                around the file-system, searching for and parsing repos.conf/
                files.

==========

`ash-euses` ("the Program") is a rewrite of the  classic  Gentoo  Linux  utility
`euses`, originally authored by Jeroen Roovers [1, 2], as an attempt to  rectify
some of the issues presented by modern Gentoo systems to the  original  utility.
The Program is still unstable and in an alpha state, however due to its relative
simplicity, should become usable shortly, with a featureset comparable  to  that
of Roovers' tool.

The Program requires the standard C library to build, and has only  been  tested
on glibc, however should work on any compliant implementation.  It  is  written,
in its entirety, in C99, to  work  exclusively  on  Gentoo  Linux  systems.   It
supports the modern `location` attribute notation, set in the various repos.conf
files [3], and is capable of traversing an arbitrary number  of  *.{,local.}desc
files in a similarly arbitrary number of repositories.  The existence of a valid
PORTDIR (obsolete) or `repos.conf/gentoo.conf` is  a  hard  requirement  of  the
Program, as defined at [4].

I welcome any contributions or enquiries, which can be directed in plain-text to
ash@suugaku.co.uk.  The Program and all of its components are released under the
WTF Public License, aside from where  stated  otherwise  (the  standard  library
headers).  The entire licence can be viewed at [5] or in the  Program's  LICENCE
file.
